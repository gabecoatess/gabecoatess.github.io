# My New Website
I am thrilled to finally announce the launch of my new website/blog! It has been a long time coming, and I apologize for the delay. Life has been incredibly busy, but I wanted to ensure that I found the perfect theme and site generator that aligned with my needs. I have decided to go with Hexo and the "Oranges" theme, which I believe gives my blog a modern and unique look.

Setting up my new blog was surprisingly easy with Hexo. I was initially drawn to this site generator because of its simplicity and flexibility compared to something like Jekyll. Hexo allows me to focus on creating content rather than spending too much time on technical aspects. Don't get me wrong, Jekyll is not at all complex, I just haven't had any luck with setting it up exactly how I want it. Not to mention, all the themes that I have seen so far are kind of mundane. With Hexo, there is significantly less themes available but luckily I found the "Oranges" theme which has a sleek design and minimalist approach. It perfectly complements the type of content I will be sharing.

Compared to other popular site generators like Jekyll, Hexo offers a refreshing alternative. While Jekyll is undoubtedly a great choice for many, I wanted something that stood out from the crowd. Hexo provides a unique and customizable platform for me to showcase my work and ideas.

# What to Expect
Now that my blog is up and running, I am excited to start sharing more about my experiences in cybersecurity, IT, and anything else related to these fields. I have a lot to rework when it comes to my home lab and projects, so hopefully that will provide you and I with a ton of content. I may look into doing YouTube as a hobby but it ultimately depends on time.

Another thing I am excited to share is a ton of corporate cybersecurity stuff. Though this type of content may not cover everything as in-depth as I want, my aim is to provide good resources to new engineers. My first year as a help desk technician revealed that much of what I had learned for certifications and in my personal home lab really only consisted of fundamental stuff. The concepts and ideas I've gained from studying are valuable, but it's important to note that the tools and methodologies used live in the field are significantly different from what's typically done in a home lab.

Anyways, that is quite literally all I have for today. If you want to check out some of the source for the blog, [click here for my GitHub page](https://www.github.com/gabecoatess/). Just find my blog repository and give it a look (it's definitely better than Jekyll.)

P.S. for some reason the tags and about page don't work yet. Still trying to find my way around it.
